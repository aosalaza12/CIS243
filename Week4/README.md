# This week 4 - overview:

## This week we will begin learning about and applying control statements. Control statements are at the heart of all programming. Control statements allow us to consider options and values and then choose paths to take and actions to take in our programs. Writing control statements is based on the use of algorithms. Algorithms are a series of actions that will lay out actions to be executed and the order in which these actions are executed. Control statements allow us to specify a series of sequentially executed actions and set controls to determine which paths provide alternate paths from the sequence. We will also build on the previously covered content and explore some additional ways to build C# programs.
