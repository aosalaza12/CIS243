# This week 3 - overview:

## This week we will take some time to learn about the basics of writing code using classes. Although we will usually deal with programs that are not based in classes, it is important that you become familiar with both ways of coding programs. This chapter which is extended from last week will also address in detail the concepts of value types and reference types. We will also build on the first two weeks' content and explore some additional ways to build C# programs.
