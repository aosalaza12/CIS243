# This week 5 - overview:

## This week we will continue our look at control statements. Control statements are at the heart of all programming and allow us to consider options and values and then choose paths to take and actions to take in our programs. This week the focus will be on counter-controlled loops and sentinal loops such as for, and do-while structures. The switch selection statement and the break/continue statements will also be introduced. Finally, we will expand the use of logical operators to build more complex conditional and control structures. As always we will also build on the previously covered content and explore some additional ways to build C# programs.
