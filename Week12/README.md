# This week 12 - overview:

## This week we will go back to some of the beginning concepts covered in weeks 2 and 3. You may want to go to chapter 4 and review the concepts again. The purpose of this class has been to introduce you to the basic concepts of programming as they apply to C# and ultimately to any language. And so we come around full circle to how these concepts fit into construction of code using classes. Review again the concepts of constructors, value types and reference types, instance variables, and methods as well as static class methods and variables. As always we will also build on the previously covered content and explore some additional ways to build C# programs.
