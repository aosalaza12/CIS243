# This week 8 - overview:

## This week and next we will begin a study of arrays. Arrays are tied to looping constructs since populating and accessing array elements is based in the use of loops. An array is a list or series of values. Arrays provide an organized way to accumulate and use like data. Most importantly, arrays are a datatype just as a primitive datatype. Arrays are always made up of elements of the same datatype (int, long, string, char etc).  Arrays are made up of elements that are ordered beginning and are accessed by referencing through an integer subscript starting with element zero (0). Arrays are always stored in contiguous memory spaces in the same way as data about a payment amount in a spreadsheet would be stored in a single row, one cell following another. Arrays in C# derive from a class and are declared as objects (remember week 2 and 3). Because they are objects, they have properties and static methods such as the length property, the length method, or the sort method. These static methods can be used to manipulate arrays. As always we will also build on the previously covered content and explore some additional ways to build C# programs.
