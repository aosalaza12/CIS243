# This week 9 - overview:

## This week we will continue the study of arrays. Arrays are variables and variables are grouped as either value types or reference types. Arrays are reference types which means that referring to them refers to a memory location that contains values that are all of the same type (int, double, string etc). An array is a memory reference (address) to an array object. Arrays as objects can be passed as arguments to arrays and can be passed either by value or by reference. As always we will also build on the previously covered content and explore some additional ways to build C# programs.
